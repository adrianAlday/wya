          There{"'"}s a wise saying that goes like this: A real gentleman never
          discusses women he{"'"}s broken up with or how much tax he{"'"}s paid.
          Actually, this is a total lie. I just made it up. Sorry! But if there
          really were such a saying, I think that one more condition for being a
          gentleman would be keeping quiet about what you do to stay healthy. A
          gentleman shouldn{"'"}t go on and on about what he does to stay fit.
          At least that{"'"}s how I see it.
